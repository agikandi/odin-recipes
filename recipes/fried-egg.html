    <h1>Fried Eggs!</h1>

    <p>I think this is quite a universal dish. It's simple, yet spectacular - like potatoes!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Eggs (as few or as many as you'd like)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Put some oil on the pan and get it hot! (not too hot though, you wouldn't want to scrape egg off the pan because it got cooked too fast!)</li>
        <li>Crack some eggs and empty the contents onto the pan (or, you could beat them in a cup first, but difference is minimal, I think)</li>
        <li>Let the eggs cook until the sides <strong>begin</strong> to turn brown.</li>
        <li>Turn the egg(s) and once again, wait for the sides to turn brown.</li>
        <li>Serve, and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
