<p>Milk tea has been around for centuries, taken by the sultans and the kings, as well as the peasants. Although some people do like the idea of taking tea without milk, in the same syntax as Maria Antoinette, if they won't have have a latte, then let them take the tea with only a bit of water!</p>
<p>I can't even remember the first time I took some of this tea - some call it a latte, but from where I come from, it's just called tea. It is usually taken in the morning with some sliced bread that's "been spread" (if you know what I mean, hehe), but some children do dip the bread in the tea, just for a bit of fun before you have to zone into classes and listen to the teacher drone on about algebra (URGHHH!!!)</p>
<p>So, then, let's get started!</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Half a cup of water/li>
    <li>Half a cup of milk</li>
    <li>One teabag of your choice</li>
    <li>Some sugar or honey (for those who like it a bit sweet)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Measure out the milk and the water, and put them to a boil (or, if your feeling a bit lazy, use a microwave, why don't you?)</li>
    <li>Pour out your boiled mixture into a cup (teacup or mug depending on how much you want)</li>
    <li>Put the teabag into the cup and let it sit in the mixture for about 3-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add sugar and/or honey at this point (as you'd like) to taste. Most people shoot for 2-3 teaspoons, but hey, you can add eight, and no one could stop you! (Although, you might get some dirty looks, for sure!)</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
